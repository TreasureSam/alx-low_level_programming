Stuctures and considering Linked list

What is Linked List?
A linked list is a linear data structure which can store a collection of "nodes" connected together via links i.e. pointers. Linked lists nodes are not stored at a contiguous location, rather they are linked using pointers to the different memory locations. A node consists of the data value and a pointer to the address of the next node within the linked list.

A linked list is a dynamic linear data structure whose memory size can be allocated or de-allocated at run time based on the operation insertion or deletion, this helps in using system memory efficiently. Linked lists can be used to implment various data structures like a stack, queue, graph, hash maps, etc.
